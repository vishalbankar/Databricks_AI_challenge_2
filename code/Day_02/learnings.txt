*Medallion Architecture **
What Is It?

The Medallion Architecture (also called multi-hop architecture) is a data design pattern recommended by Databricks for organizing data in a Lakehouse.
Data moves through three layers of progressively improving quality. Each layer has a strict purpose and no layer should be skipped.

| **Layer**  | **Also Called**          | **Data State**                                                            | **Who Uses It**                    | **Format**                |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Bronze** | Raw / Landing Zone       | Exactly as received. No cleanup. Store everything including corrupt rows. | Data Engineers only                | Delta (strings preferred) |
| **Silver** | Validated / Cleaned      | Deduped, null-handled, quality-checked, typed schema, enriched.           | Engineers + Data Scientists        | Delta (typed)             |
| **Gold**   | Curated / Business-Ready | Aggregated, feature-engineered, one row per entity (user/product).        | Analysts + ML Engineers + Business | Delta (optimized)         |
